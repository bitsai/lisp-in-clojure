A tiny Lisp interpreter in Clojure, done by implementing apply and eval as shown on page 13 of LISP 1.5 Programmer's Manual:
http://www.softwarepreservation.org/projects/LISP/book/LISP%201.5%20Programmers%20Manual.pdf/view

Inspired by:
http://onestepback.org/index.cgi/Tech/Ruby/LispInRuby.red

Notes:
- Had to deviate from the manual in two places.  See lines marked with ";;!!" in _apply and _eval.  Still investigating.
