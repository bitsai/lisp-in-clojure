eval_pg.clj implements eval from Paul Graham's "The Roots of Lisp" paper:
http://lib.store.yahoo.net/lib/paulgraham/jmc.ps

eval_pm.clj implements apply and eval from page 13 of LISP 1.5 Programmer's Manual:
http://www.softwarepreservation.org/projects/LISP/book/LISP%201.5%20Programmers%20Manual.pdf/view

reader.clj implements functionality to convert an expression string to nested vectors.

repl.clj runs a simple REPL.

tests.clj runs examples from Paul Graham's paper.

This was inspired by:
http://onestepback.org/index.cgi/Tech/Ruby/LispInRuby.red

Notes:
1) eval_pm.clj had to deviate from the Programmer's Manual in some places; see commented lines in _pairlis, _apply and _eval.  I believe this is because I use vectors instead of cons cells as the underlying data structure.  Interestingly, eval_pg.clj is not affected by this.

To-do:
1) Throw exception if an atom has no value in the environment?

2) Clean up tests.clj

3) Implement ' macro.
