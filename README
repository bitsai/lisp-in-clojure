lisp-pg.clj is an interpreter implementing eval from Paul Graham's "The Roots of Lisp" paper:
http://lib.store.yahoo.net/lib/paulgraham/jmc.ps

lisp-pm.clj is an interpreter implementing apply and eval from page 13 of LISP 1.5 Programmer's Manual:
http://www.softwarepreservation.org/projects/LISP/book/LISP%201.5%20Programmers%20Manual.pdf/view

tests.clj tests the interpreters using examples from Paul Graham's paper.

This project was inspired by:

Notes:
1) lisp-pm.clj deviates from the Programmer's Manual in two places.  See lines marked with ";;!!" in _apply and _eval.
